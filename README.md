# edge-weighting
This is a tool made by John Chan to make scripting the edge weight calculations easier. The folder should contain edge_weight.sh and edge_weight.R. The shell script can be run without having to type ./edge_weight.sh by placing it within /usr/local/bin/. The script takes either 6 or 7 arguments which are detailed in the comments of edge_weight.sh. If 7 arguments are used, the 7th argument is a comma delimited list of nodes of interest.
