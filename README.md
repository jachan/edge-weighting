# edge-weighting
This is a tool made by John Chan to make scripting the edge weight calculations easier. The folder should contain edge_weight.sh and edge_weight.R. The shell script can be made runnable by placing it within /usr/local/bin/. The script requires 6 arguments which are detailed in the comments of edge_weight.sh
